# Auth Server Express Typescript

Simple auth server for conecting to the Spotify Web API to use the [authorization code flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow).
This application is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 20.x or higher is required.

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Environment variables

This application depends on environment variables to run. 
For a local build create an `.env` file in the root folder and include the following variables:

```console
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
REDIRECT_URI
AUTHENICATION_SERVER_ROUTE="https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize"
AUTHENICATION_TOKEN_ROUTE="https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token"
```

The `REDIRECT_URI` is the callback route of the applicaiton. You can use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` for developement or 
replace the `localhost` domain with your url from the production server when deployed. The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` are generated by Spotify 
when [creating a new application](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started#create-an-app).

### Build & run the application

To build the Typescript application:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

Running the application:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

Or for dev using Nodemon:
